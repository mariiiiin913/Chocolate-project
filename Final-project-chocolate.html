	<hr />
	<p>
	<span class="swisschocolate">Swiss chocolate</span> is chocolate produced
	in Switzerland. While cacao beans and other ingredients such as sugar can
	originate from outside Switzerland, the actual production of the chocolate
	must take place in Switzerland. Switzerland's chocolates have earned an
	international reputation for high quality with many famous international
	chocolate brands.
